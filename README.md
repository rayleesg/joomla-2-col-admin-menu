# Multicolumn Admin Menu for Joomla 3.7+

Do you use many extensions in Joomla or are an enthusiast that loves to try new one all the time? Well, I am!

Except for a couple of admin templates for J2.5 several eons agp, like RocketTheme's Mission Control, there haven't been many options for Joomla users to customize their backends very well. One particular feature of Mission Control was the use of extended or split-column menus to aid the clutter of too many components installed. There are a few scripts here and there but most break after updates or upgrades. That especially happened to me after upgrading to J3.7.

Well, if you'ev always been looking for this, look no further! I thought it'll be kewl to just code this out once and for all for others to use and perhaps improve upon. Joomla defenitely need better options and solutions for their administrators, especially since it's slightly more difficult to comprehend, tweak and optimize.

Cheers all!
